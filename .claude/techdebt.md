# Tech Debt / Future Work

Running log of deferred refactors, follow-ups, and "do it properly later"
items surfaced during work sessions but intentionally **not** scheduled or
executed at the time. This is a reference backlog, not a roadmap — nothing
here should be picked up unless explicitly requested in a future session.

When adding an entry: say what it is, why it wasn't done now, and roughly
how big/risky it is. When an item is finally addressed, delete its entry
(git history keeps the record).

## Ghost path-node grips after leaving path-edit (unreproduced)

An Obsidian-plugin log (2026-09-28) showed 4 `pathpointgrip_*` still
`display:inline` in select mode, belonging to no selected path. Every exit
route tried in a browser (setMode, click empty/other shape, Escape, tool
buttons, undo) hides them correctly, so the trigger is unknown. The debug
snapshot now includes `pathEditing.mode`, flags any visible grip outside
`path`/`pathedit` as stale, and records grip x/y; freehand closes log a
`path-draw-commit` event. Next time it shows up, the log should identify the
sequence. Don't add speculative hide-all calls before then.

## Closed subpaths must carry an explicit closing lineto

The node editor (`Path#init`, `opencloseSubPath`, delete-node) models a closed
subpath as `M A … L(back to A) Z`; the closing lineto is A's only grip. Do
**not** "dedupe" it away (that was tried and removed every drawn path's start
node grip). `ensureExplicitClosingSegments()` in `path-method.js` repairs
`Z`-only subpaths (external SVGs, or saved by the reverted change) whenever a
path enters the editor; other absolute-path shapes it doesn't cover
(relative segments, `H`/`V`) are left as-is.

## `tests/e2e/group-transforms.spec.js`: 4 tests fail on a clean checkout

Seen 2026-10-07 on unmodified master (`preserve group translate transform…`,
`multiple arrow key movements…`, `rotation followed by movement…`,
`multiple movements preserve group structure…`). Not investigated.
