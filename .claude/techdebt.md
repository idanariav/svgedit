# Tech Debt / Future Work

Running log of deferred refactors, follow-ups, and "do it properly later"
items surfaced during work sessions but intentionally **not** scheduled or
executed at the time. This is a reference backlog, not a roadmap — nothing
here should be picked up unless explicitly requested in a future session.

When adding an entry: say what it is, why it wasn't done now, and roughly
how big/risky it is. When an item is finally addressed, delete its entry
(git history keeps the record).

## From the Phase 1-11 cleanup roadmap (`.claude/plans/i-want-to-do-immutable-kettle.md`)

The following were explicitly called out in that plan as "Deferred / optional
future refactors" — each needs its own planning pass before execution:

- **Reorganize `svgcanvas.js` state bag (80+ flat properties)** into concern
  objects (selection / drawing / style / history / zoom), keeping getters for
  API compat. Very high effort; 100+ call sites.
